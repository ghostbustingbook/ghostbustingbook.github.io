			<h2 class = "subheading center">Santa Claus - Greed to Love</h2>
			<p>In the year 2014, three boys were students at two universities. One they attended for a job, and the other for meeting likeminded individuals - the university of theology, in Bucharest, Romania.</p>
			<p>They decided to, for fun, link the birth of Jesus with Santa Claus through a little song. It blew up and got hundreds of thousands of views in Romania in a few days, and they took this as a sign to start pursuing making more songs, from what I have collected. Enjoy this alternative Christmas origin story, which has not made rounds as of yet in America, Britain, and the like.</p>
			
			<p>Cometh an old man to our gate.</br>
			An old man, with healthy face.</br>
			He asked if it's possible,</br>
			That we host him here.</p>
			
			<p>"Our home is open,</br>
			O' old and kind man!</br>
			Come sit with us and the food enjoy</br>
			For weary you must be of the long way!</p>
			
			<p>After he sat at the table.</br>
			He offered thanks to the Lord.</br>
			And began to tell a tale</br>
			Of the birth of Christ.</p>
			
			<p>We, so looked,</br>
			Looking towards him, surprised.</br>
			And to the words we listened,</br>
			Next to our dear parents.</p>
			
			</br>
			
			<p>We were told that there was once,</br>
			Very long, very very long ago,</br>
			An old man, "Christmas" his name.</br>
			Bad of heart and full of evil.</p>
			
			<p>And one night, at his gate,</br>
			Someone knocking slowly</br>
			Asked that they be taken in</br>
			Until the first rays of dawn.</p>

			<p>With words of chastising.</br>
			Towards the gate running,</br>
			A young Virgin seeing,</br>
			And an old man with kind visage.</p>

			<p>And to him wishing to say -</br>
			The old greedy man he begged, saying</br>
			That to birth it had been destined</br>
			For the Virgin, the holy boy.</p>

			<p>Into the stable with sheep and cow</br>
			He chased the two in force.</br>
			To "stay there until the crack of dawn!"</br>
			With his scepter he threatened them.</p>

			<p>And there, the Virgin birth</br>
			The son of God.</br>
			Next to the sheep and cow</br>
			Of this old man.</p>
