			<p>Pope Francis said about Carlo:</p>
			<blockquote>Carlo did not fall into a trap. He saw that many young people, if they seem to be different, end up, in reality, looking like each other, by running behind what powerful people impose on them via mechanisms of consumption and stupor. In this way, they do not let the gifts that the Lord has made for them flow into them. They do not offer the world these personal and unique gifts that the Lord has sown in each one of them.</blockquote>
			<p>The Papacy is greatly supportive of humanity. Many still look to the church for escape and "buying your way to heaven", and that shows at some levels of the church, but the Catholic Church is a place of great things also.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Indeed, how many young human beings want to escape the restrictive, dark, conditioning around them, and wind up trying to stand up through control.</p>
			<p>They believe they are becoming different, and powerful, yet they are repeating the same thing. "I will pick a nation to be based around.", for example. "A community".</p>
			<p>All relationships that are based around need for approval do not function. You must get sick of the constant suffering to seek a new way.</p>
			<p>Technology, and the end to a lot of the kindness that was still imbued in our society, is creating a full coming to the surface of all the issues we have kept building.</p>
			<p>This may be a bit out there, but Carlo's life even answers old dillemas, such as: "Is anyone else real?"</p>
