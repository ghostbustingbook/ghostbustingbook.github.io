			<p>The first two songs of this musical collage are from "COLAJUL Revelionului ðŸŽ† 2024 ðŸŽ† Muzica de Petrecere cu Georgiana Lobont âš¡" on YouTube. For the full experience, play the melodies also. 
			<p>To play this entire song collection in one go, perhaps picturing it as a mini-concert, open "COLAJUL Revelionului ðŸŽ† 2024 ðŸŽ† Muzica de Petrecere cu Georgiana Lobont âš¡", "Fang Shuang æ–¹æ³· â˜… Iarna spune poveÈ™ti | Official Video" and "Calin Merca si Emil Floare - Vin colindatorii" on YouTube in three unique tabs, playing the songs in that order, flipping through the pages.</p>

			<p>Life goes.</br>
			The years pass.</br>
			How many things I've been through, lord!</br>
			Cold and hot. I would do it again!</p>
