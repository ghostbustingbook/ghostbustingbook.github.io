			<p>In the crib, on the cold wheat,</br>
			Jesus, the boy, gazed</br>
			As the cow came to him</br>
			And, breathing, warmed his body.</p>

			<p>And Mary, the holy mother,</br>
			Sat surprised and also gazed,</br>
			As the cows gratitude showed,</br>
			Towards he, their master.</p>

			<p>But, suddenly there could be seen</br>
			angels, who from above descended.</br>
			Towards that most humble stable.</br>
			To the boy, who they exhilarated.</p>

			<p>And a star, beautifully, above.</br>
			Shining, showed itself.</br>
			And three mages entering inside -</br>
			To the boy they bowed.</p>

			<p>Gold, myrrh, and incense,</br>
			The mages with them had brought.</br>
			And with joy they put them</br>
			Next to Jesus's crib.</p>

			<p>And pastors of sheep came</br>
			From the valleys and the mountains.</br>
			To show respect to jesus,</br>
			By the angels having received the news.</p>
			
			</br>
			
			<p>Seeing this star, the old man,</br>
			Christmas, the bad and miserly,</br>
			Understood who are the strangers</br>
			That in this stable he hosted.</p>

			<p>And with tears of sorrow</br>
			Towards the crib, running</br>
			Forgiveness he asked for</br>
			From his merciful master.</p>

			<p>And yet, even as he told this...</br>
			The old man, the tale telling:</br>
			Tears wet his face,</br>
			And his voice was shaking.</p>

			<p>We, wishing to hear more -</br>
			"From there, what had happened?"</br>
			He told us he'd come again</br>
			In the years to come as well.</p>

			</br>

			<p>And, as he walked towards the gate,</br>
			We all followed in silence.</br>
			And he pointed with his hand.</br>
			Towards the village, as he told:</p>

			<p>"I, to all, in this night</br>
			With carolers I went</br>
			And I told to them great wonder -</br>
			Of the birth of Christ."</p>

			<p>"I, to all, in this night</br>
			With carolers I went.</br>
			And I told to them great wonder -</br>
			Of the birth of Christ."</p>
