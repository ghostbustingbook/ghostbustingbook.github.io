			<p>White snow is seen beyond.</br>
			White and clean as in a dream-</br>
			It snows, it snows in the world.</br>
			And gates in the sky have opened.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Today, I want to hear something.</br>
			Which I've never told you-</br>
			Or written to you.</p>
			<p>I want to give you a gift.</br>
			And in your palm -</br>
			Extend your heart!</p>
			<p>Winter tells tales.</br>
			With snow and children-</br>
			Maybe you don't know,</br>
			But winter - tells them to me every day-</p>
			<p>Winter comes, dreaming.</br>
			If you wish, you can ask her.</br>
			For love - and for hope.</br>
			Any dream from today or yesterday...</p>
			<p>*children laughing*</p>
			</br>
			<p>The trees are empty,</br>
			But on their branches-</br>
			Stars of ice and crystal!</p>
			<p>In the evening</br>
			The town is blue!</br>
			Yellow - lits up a lamp.</p>
			<p>Today, I want to hear something.</br>
			Which I've never told you-</br>
			Or written to you.</p>
			<p>I want to give you a gift.</br>
			And in your palm -</br>
			Extend your heart!</p>
