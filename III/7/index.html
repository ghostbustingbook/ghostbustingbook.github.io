			<p>The final song of this collage comes from a priest. For his defiance towards communism through his art, he was arrested in '79, spending 10 years in communist prison camps, in 1989 being taken to Sighet, the worst of these prisons.</p>
			<p>In Sighet, he died of hypothermia after only two weeks, because the guards would throw water buckets on the prisoners' faces every two hours to keep them in a state of panic. This is his song.</p>

			<p>So come the Carolers,</br>
			As they once came.</br>
			Clouds are clouds.</p>
			<p>To carol</br>
			On this wonderful night.</br>
			Clouds are clouds.</p>
			<p>But, their mouth is burned.</br>
			And their eyes are in tears.</br>
			~Clouds are clouds.</p>
			<p>Too in vain blood-</br>
			Too in vain suffering.</br>			
			Clouds are clouds...</p>
			</br>
			<p>Christian hosts!</br>
			Welcome them inside.</br>
			Clouds are clouds.</p>
			<p>And, as it is nature,</br>
			Welcome them to the table.</br>
			Clouds are clouds.</p>
			<p>The lord sends them-</br>
			To try our mercy.</br>
			Clouds are clouds.</p>
			<p>Great men of today -</br>
			Open your vilas...</br>
			Clouds are clouds.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Silent footsteps,</br>
			Weak hands.</br>
			Clouds are clouds.</p>
			<p>Their voice shakes -</br>
			They don't know how to carol-</br>
			Clouds are clouds.</p>
			<p>If they sit at the gate,</br>
			And say nothing-</br>
			~Clouds are clouds.</p>
			<p>Great men of today,</br>
			Be afraid.</br>
			Clouds are clouds...</p>
			</br>
			<p>Silent is the question-</br>
			Which resounds outside.</br>
			Clouds are clouds.</p>
			<p>He died for nothing!</br>
			What have you made of this land?!</br>
			Clouds are clouds.</p>
			<p>Still in cold and hunger-</br>
			Still with outstretched hands.</br>
			Clouds are clouds.</p>
			<p>At strangers' gates-</br>
			Which stay closed to us.</br>
			Clouds are clouds.</p>
			</br>
			<p>So come the carolers</br>
			As they once came.</br>
			Clouds are clouds.</p>
			<p>To carol</br>
			On this wonderful night.</br>
			Clouds are clouds.</p>
			<p>But, their mouth is burned.</br>
			And their eyes are in tears.</br>
			~Clouds are clouds.</p>
			<p>Too in vain blood.</br>
			Too in vain suffering.</br>
			Clouds are clouds...</p>
