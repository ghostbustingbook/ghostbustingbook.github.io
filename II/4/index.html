                        <p>From one point, you create two expanding lines. At one point on each line as you keep expanding, you connect the two lines, and get a triangle.</p>
                        <p>Then, zero represents the zeroth triangle; One represents the first triangle; Three represents the second triangle, one point and two line tips opposite the first point; Six represents the third, with another point added on the two lines' path, and a space inbetween. Etc.</p>
                        <img src = "../../pix/II_illustrations/trinums.jpg" alt = "Triangular Numbers three and six" />
                        <p>There are more triangular numbers. 10, 15, 21, etc. The 4th triangular number is the sum of all numbers starting from one up to four. So, 1+2+3+4. If n represents a number from one to infinity, the nth triangular number is the sum of all numbers starting from one up to n, so 1+2+3+...+n.</p>
                        <p>Most numbers you can create on the paper geometrically. All drawings, representations, are yours, and so never need you fear simplifying in your representations. A blind man can feel the idea of a circle, a repeating of a series of things. Such a man can also have the realization that it is not a circle, but a spiral, if you consider time. This is therefore universal.</p>
                        <p>The idea of the 3rd triangular number can be written also as such, for less space usage:<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tr><td align="center"><i>3</i><td>
    <tr><td align="center"><big>∑</big> <td><i>n</i> = 6
    <tr><td align="center"><i>n</i>=1 <td>
</table></p>
                        <p>The letter in the middle is capital Sigma, a Greek letter. As you approach the Sigma from below you set your initial health points, call them n. You turn right and decide by which value your n should be changed. For example 2n means two 'n's, two times an n. Here, the n will remain with it's default value, and all further addition will happen by numbers that grow by one point, rather than 2 points for 2n, or other numbers of points for any other scoring system.</p>
                        <p>Finally, once all the numbers from one (initial n) to three have been added you have crossed the Sigma, and found your final value. This becomes more useful in a situation such as this: "How would you represent the 11th triangular number?" For bonus points, find the 11th triangular number without using a calculator. To write the operation horrizontally, use "1+2+... = result", where "=" is the horrizontal equal sign.</p>
