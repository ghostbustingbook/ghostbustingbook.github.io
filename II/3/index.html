			<p>You only need addition to form one of the most beautiful mathematical structures. This is done by adding each number once to it's left, and once to it's right.</p>
			<p>The one on row zero, at the top, becomes a one to the left and a one to the right. Then, each one goes once to the left and once to the right. There will be a two in the center, right below the one on row zero. This continues in the same manner.</p>
			<p>Diagonal zero has only ones; Diagonal one is the group of all natural numbers, from one to infinity; Diagonal two is the triangular numbers; Diagonal three is the pyramid numbers.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, on the vertical, the rows are powers of 11, and the sum of each row is a "power of two". With each one, they double, because each number on the previous row goes once to the left and once to the right. Starting from a one that goes left once and right another time, you get two. Then, you get four. Then 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, and so on. By the time two is to the 16th power, it is 65536. By the 32th power - row 31 counting from 0 - we reach 4.29 billion as the total sum, and a stunning 32 terms per line.</p>
			<p>The rows themselves hold secrets. The 10th row holds already an approxiamtion for Euler's constant, one of the three most used constants in math.</p>
			<p>There are also many more connections, some not related to the rows, diagonals or columns, but shapes that form within this algebraic triangle.</p>
