			<p>Transalpine Gaul is also home to many beautiful locations, not least the city of Massilia, modern Marseille, founded by the Greeks, and later annexed to Rome by Julius Caesar. Off it's coast are the very small Stoechades islands, at the mouth of the Rhone river. They are called Στοιχάδες, "Stoihades", by the Greeks, from the fact that they are aligned, like a work of art.</p>
			<p>Narbonna, Arelatum and Pictavis were Roman colonies, sometimes Transalpine Gaul being known as Gallia Narbonensis by the Romans, after the town of Narbonna.</p> 
			<p>Another town in the area, Burdigalim - modern Bordeaux - was founded by the Gauls.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Northern Transalpine Gaul is home to the Brittons, as mentioned. Gaul and Britain often shared a connection, Celtic mages going from Gaul to Britain to study.</p>
			<p>Beyond the Rhine is Germania, a land of many tribes through history. The Quadi and the Macrommani in the East; The Suebi in the north; The Saxons near the sea and in unaccessible swamps; And more, such as the Tubantes, Chamavi, Bructeri, Amsivari and Tuungri - from which the German state of Thuringia is named.</p>
