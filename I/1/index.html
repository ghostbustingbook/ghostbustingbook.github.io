			<h2 class = "subheading center">Of The World</h2>
			<p>The world, as the Romans saw it, must have been made of Earth, sky and water.</p>
			<p>It is God's work of art.</p>
			<p>In Latin, "world" is "<span lang = "la">mundus</span>", called so by philosophers because it is in perpetual "<span lang = "la">motus</span>" (genitive <span lang = "la">motÅ«s</span>), movement and change.</p>
			<p>The skies are made for the angels; The air mainly for flying creatures; The sea for the fish; And the Earth for humans and animals.</p>
			<p>This world is made of very small things called atoms, which cannot be divided, than then form the elements: Air, water, fire, and earth.</p>
			<p>From the elements come rivers, lakes, mountains; Salt, acidic, sweet and other waters; The abyss, those parts of the sea that none can penetrate them; The swamps, the hills; And many more phenomena.</p>
			<p>Of these phenoma, in regards to the waters, there have been several floods in history.</p> 
			<p>The first known flood is the flood of the time of Noah. Back then, it is believed the evils of the world had caused the Omnipotent distress. The whole world was replaced by sea, only one space in the Heavens escaping the event.</p>
			<p>Evidence of this first flood is said to be the existence of shellfish and oysters at the top of mountains, and that we often see places that are hollowed out by water.</p>
			<p>In our times, geology shows that this might have to do with the movements of the tectonic plates that lead to places being able to once be underwater, and later be above sea level, or vice versa</p>
			<p>This ancient proof now seems to be a proof of something even greater, and leads us to wonder how this moving of the continents had it's influence on the history of life on Earth.</p>
