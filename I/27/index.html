			<p>Often, Egypt was divided into two: Upper and Lower Egypt - What's important to remember is that the Egyptians didn't make their maps as we do. "Upper" and "Lower" refers here to the course of the Nile.</p>
			<p>So, Aegyptus Thebaica, as the Romans called it, is the region of Egypt known as Upper Egypt, and Northern Egypt is known as Lower Egypt. The Nile goes "down"stream, just like anything falls towards the Earth down, not above, typically, unless there is a great force to push it up.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Egypt is home, also, to several great towns. Elephantine, Thebes, Memphis, Heliopolis, for example, feature heavily in native Egyptian mythology.</p>
			<p>Memphis was built by Epaphus, son of Jupiter. It is the birthplace of paper, where some of the best Mathematicians have lived. The city also has been home to great interest in the magical arts.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Tanis is where the pharaohs lived, and is believed to be the area in which the daughter of the Pharaoh hid a boy she had conceived for three months, and after, unable to hide him, took for him an ark of bulrushes - also commonly called roundheads.</p>
			<p>She daubed the ark with slime and pitch, a resin, setting the boy inside it on the brink of the Nile river, between the irises, also known as "flags".</p>
			<p>She then came down to bathe in the river with her maids, sending one of them to fetch the ark. This boy would grow up to be Moses, given to one of the Hebrew nurses to take care of him.</p>
