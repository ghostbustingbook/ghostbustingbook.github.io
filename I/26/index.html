			<p>And so we enter Egypt! Remember, Egypt is sometimes, administratively, considered a part of Asia.</p>
			<p>Egypt, which was previously called "Aeria", is named after Aegyptus, a brother of Danai, or, as this mythical king of Africa is known in English, Danaus. Aegyptus was also the grandson of Libya and Poseidon.</p>
			<p>From the East, it borders the Red Sea, or , Mare Rubrum, going west to where it borders Africa, Libya, through it's easternmost province, Libya Cyrenensis, and the area of Garamantis in the south.</p>
