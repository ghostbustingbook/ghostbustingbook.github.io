                        <p>The second flood was in Achaea, at the time of the patriarchy of Jacob in Judea, and the rule of Ogyges, founder and king of Eleusis, home of the Eleusinian mysteries.</p>
                        <p>The third flood was in Thessaly, at the time of Moses and king Amphictyon, who reigned first in Thermopylae, and later as the third ruler of Athens after king Cecrops the I, who taught Cecropia (Athens) marriage, reading and writing, and ceremonial burial.</p>
                        <p>During the third flood, at least to a small extent, the largest part of Thessaly's people managed to reduce their suffering by seeking refuge in the mountains. Especially in Parnassus mountain.</p>

At the top there is Macedonia, which continues outside the range of our investigation. In it lies Mt. Olympus. To the west of Macedonia is Dalmatia, followed by Epirus. Within Epirus is a region called Chaonia, or, Molosia. Then, to Epirus's south-east, and Macedonia's south, lies Thessaly. There are the Parnassus mountains, and to it's east we enter through a somewhat narrow passage Hellas, where the city of Thebes will be our first encounter. After that, in the center-west, nearing the border with another two regions called Achaea and Arcadia, there is the town of Eleusis, home to the Eleusinian mysteries, and further west lies Attica, home to the city of Athens, formerly known as Cecropia. Moving even deeper, there are the two regions of Achaea, where the Erymanthos river lies, and Arcadia, home to Sparta and the Inachos river. A sub-region of Arcadia that is well-known is Argolis."/>
			<p>Deucalion, a king in the area, offered them shelter in boats, allowing them to live in the twin Parnassus mountains.</p>
			<p>They were treated pretty well, and given chances to begin not just going through life aimlessly, but to also contemplate the world. On account of this event it is also said the people of this Greek story - living with the minerals and stones - had in them sown a "hardened" heart.</p>
