			<p>There are three important mountains in Greece. Mount Olympus, the Parnassus mountains and the Ceraunii mountains. The first are incredibly tall, and were once home to Gods.</p>
			<p>the second are a place where the Gods Apollo and Liber lived. It seems that although these two became names for different mountains, at the time, Helicon, the name of Cythaeron's brother Helicon, was used interchangeably for the Parnassus Mountains also.</p>
			<p>The third and final well-known mountain range are named after the many rivers of the area, so they are dense, "crebris" with rivers.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Greece has many famous cities. Athens, Sparta, Thebes, Miletus - home to the philosopher and mathematician Thales - Argos - Just to name some of the most well-known ones.</p>
			<p>Beginning in the North, the region of Dalmatia is named after Delmis, the largest town in the area. Then, Epirus is named after Pyrrhus, a son of Achilles, A part of Epirus known as Chaonia was also previously named in a similar manner from Pyrrhus' son, Molosus, such that this sub-region was known as Molosia.</p>
			<p>Next, Hellas: Home to Athens, it is further subdivided into Boeotia in the north, and Peloponennsis in the southern areas, bordering the Peloponnese - hence the name.</p>
			<p>In the Peloponnese first is Achaea, in the north and west, home to the Erymanthos river, called so from Mount Erymanthos, which appears to have been named so during, or before the Bronze Age.</p>
			<p>Second, in the south and east, there is Arcadia, home to Argolis, and the Inachos river.</p>
