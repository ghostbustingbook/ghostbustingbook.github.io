			<p>The island of Delos lies in the middle of the Cyclades. It is called Delos because after the second flood, during the time of Ogyges, when night covered the world for months, the first place that the sun shone Delos. The Greeks call manifestation, or appearance δῆλον, "dilon". The island is also called Ortygia because it is the first place that the quail bird was seen, the quail being called ὄρτυγας, "ortigas", by the Greeks.</p>
			<p>As Hera attempted to pursue Leto - who acted as a consort to Zeus - as she was pregnant, it was on this island that the Goddess of motherhood found a refuge.</p>

			<p>Melos is one of the Cyclades, one of the roundest islands in the world; From which fact is derived it's name.</p>
			<p>Iasion, said to be a son of Electra, is known as the founder of mystic rites on the island of Samothrace, the first island to the right as you sail into the Aegean from the Hellespont. Some versions of the myth conclude with Iasion and the agricultural hero Triptolemus then becoming the Gemini constellation.</p>
			<p>From Iasion were born Philomelum and Plutum, and from Philomelum Pareantum.</p>
			<p>Thus, the island and city Paron are named; Being known previously as Minoia. It is home to snow-white marble.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Chios is called as such in the Syrian tongue for being the place of birth for the method of torture using an easy to manuever strip of leather or cord, known as a whip, to inflict "lashes". A lash is known in the Syrian tongue as 'chio'.</p>
			<p>Samos is another island in the Aegean sea, where the Goddess Juno was born, wife of Jupiter. From this island are Sibylla Samia - from which the name Sibyl, meaning prophetess, as Sibylla prophecized the birth of Jesus in the stable - and Pythagoras Samius, Pythagora, well-known for the Pythagorean theorem and his philosophy regarding the numerical essence of things.</p>
			<p>It is also said that the first earthenware vases are from this island, such that these vases are sometimes called "Samia".</p>
