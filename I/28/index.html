			<p>Heliopolis is interpreted in Latin as the "City of the sun", from Greek <span lang = "el">ἥλιος</span>, hēlios, meaning sun, and "polis", city.</p>
			<p>It was home to the priest Petephres, and is mentioned in the book of Ezechiel.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Alexandria was built by Alexander the Great, though there was previously a village, and potentially a town also in the area called Noo, which was later turned into Alexandria.</p>
			<p>It is the head town of Egypt.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Thebes was built, by Cadmus, the legendary Pheonician hero. From it, the southern part of Egypt is called "Thebaica".</p>
			<p>There is another "Thebes" in the area of Hellas called Boeotia, in Greece. It's originator is the same Cadmus, which founded the citadel "Cadmea" there.</p>
			</br>
			<p>Moving south, we enter Ethiopia, beginning south of the Nile and southeast of Garamantis. Land of infamous rulers such as Cassiopeia, and land which often features in Egyptian mythology as the annoying, pesky competitor to the south.</p>
			<p>It is home to the Aethiopians and the Pamphagi, which are known for their great size. And, at last, it is home to many amazing and dangerous beasts, some of them monstrous and terrible.</p>
			<p>The camelopardus - giraffe - coincidentally also the name of a constellation, which is also more often called Camelopardalis. A large, but faint constellation of the northern sky representing a giraffe.</p>
			<p>The basilisk, and the huge dragon snakes, out of which brains made out of jewel can be extracted, if you can defeat them.</p>
			<p>Precious stones are generally to be found here.</p>
			</br>
			<p>South of Ethiopia are the Antipodes, mythical peoples mentioned in Greek philosophy, standing on the edge of one of the three other continents besides those we know, which none, or very few from our side of the world have managed to enter.</p>
