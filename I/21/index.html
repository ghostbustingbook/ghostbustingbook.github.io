			<p>Beyond that there is Zeugis, or Cartaginis, which is home to Great Carthage, the original home of the famous Carthaginians, who fought Rome in the three Punic Wars.</p>
			<p>The word Punic comes from Poeni, which is how the Romans often called the Carthaginians, besides Carthaginenses. Poeni meant to the Romans a "Punic Phoenician". "Phoeni". Contemporary theories suggest the word to originate from Φοινίκη (Phoiníkē).</p>
			<p>Zeugis goes from the west where it borders Numidia, to the east, where the Sicillian Sea, and the strait of Sicilly lie. Beyond the strait, to the northeast, Sicily, at the bottom of Italy, lies.</p>
			<p>In it's south, you begin to enter the areas inhabited by the Gaetuli, a people that are believed to be Getae, Gets - a Thracian tribe typically found in the area of modern Romania, then Dacia - which navigated to Africa.</p>
			</br>
			<p>The next province is Bizacena, or Byzacium. It is named as such because of it's two, "bi-", major towns, one of which is Hadrumentum.</p>
			<p>To it's west is Gaetulia, land of the Gaetuli, and to it's south, Tripolim.</p>
