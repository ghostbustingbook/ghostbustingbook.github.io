			<img src = "../../pix/I_illustrations/worldgeo.jpg" alt = "map of the world. There are several islands around the three continents: Asia, Europe and Africa. To the far north of Europe is Thyle, after which come, going south, the Orcades islands, off the coast of Britain and the island of Scotia, also known as Hibernia, or today Ireland. There is also in the Atlantic ocean the island of the fortunate, and to the south Gorgades and Hesperidum, off the coast of Mauritania. In the Indian ocean, there are the small Chryse and Argyre islands, and the large Taprobane. Finally, in the Mediterranean, starting from the East: Cyprus, Crete, the Greek Cyclades islands, Malta, Sicilly, Sardinia, Corsica, the two Belares, and Ebosus, now included in the Belares." />
			<p>The globe is called as such because of it's roundness, acting like a wheel. An ocean flows around the Earth's lands, divided into three parts.</p>
			<p>These are Asia, from the East and North to the middle; Europe, from the North and West to the middle; And Africa, from the South and West to the middle.</p>
			
			<h2 class = "subheading center" lang = "la">Europa</h2>
			<p>Beginning with the name, Europe is named as such from "Europa", a daughter of Agenor who was taken by Jupiter from Africa to Crete. Coincidentally, this king was the son of Poseison and "Libya", a name at this time for "Africa".</p>
			<p>Europe begins from the "Tanais", today Don river, on the opposite end of the continent going from the so-called "Northern Ocean" down to "Hispania", Spain.</p>
			<p>In it's middle to eastern portions it touches the Black Sea, and to the south is the Mediterranean Sea, also known as the "Great Sea", such that Europe is on almost all sides surrounded by water.</p>
