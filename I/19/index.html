			<p>Below Mauritania we encounter the Aethiopians. Unbenownst to many, the one and only Ethiopia of today, in the East of the continent, has a history that is colorful, just as Egypt's is.</p>
			<p>There are dynasties, kings and queens, and stories. Ethiopia continued to exist after Egypt's annexation into the growing Achaemenid Persian Empire.</p>
			<p>But, back to the Western part of the continent, the Hesperi are known to live here, together with peoples you find throughout the area the Romans called Aethiopia.</p>
			<p>The Pamphagi are fond of their chewing and are everywhere blessed with great size. The Anthropophagi, whose name literally means "man-eater", are those that eat human flesh. And finally, the Trochoditae are fast. So fast that their steps immediately follow the previous.</p>

			<p>East of Mauretania Tingitania is Caesariensis, home to Caesarea, or as it is known to historians and geographers, Caesarea Mauretaniae, since there is another Caesarea in modern-day Israel, renamed as such by king Herod, the land later being part of the Roman province of Syria.</p>
			<p>The town of Caesarea in Mauritania is named in homor of Caesar Augustus by "king Juba", likely Juba II.</p>
			<p>Another town of Caesariensis is Icosium, "ico-" meaning twenty, it is named in honor of the twenty generations that it was built after it's founding. Hercules passed through this town.</p>
			</br>
			<p>The main Atlas mountains, from which the part of the world ocean known as the Atlantic is named, extend from close to the Atlantic coast to the beginning of the province of Mauretania Sitifensis. Not "Stiffensis", "Sitifensis", the name of this region coming from a town inside it known as Sitifis, modern Setif.</p>
